## __APARTMENT MAINTENANCE CHARGE MANAGEMENT APP__

We are building an Apartment Maintenance charge Management App that manages maintenance charge collection at any apartment building. This is a progressive web app, ie, a web app mad to look like a native application. The primary objectives are:

1. Registration of apartments
2. Registration of tenants/owners
3. Payment of maintenance charges via online portal or cash
4. Automatic bill/receipt generation
5. Mobile notification when payment made successfully or otherwise.

Functionalities:

Admin can:
- Register apartments.
- Register tenants/owners.
- Manage user profile.
- Mail goes to admin when user changes profile data.
- Decide if mail should go to a person or not.
- Add or remove members.
- Can give admin rights to secretary or anybody else.

Admin can do all that a user can do
